IT is year 3812. Human race has achieved solid space travel and started to explore other planets and star systems for resources.

You are a newcomer on a Space Exploration Station, (S.E.S) Hope.
Your mission is to meet your new squad at the Hope station and plan out how you and your team get onto a recently found planet in the Alpha Cyrpyrus System,
a small rock planet that seems to have rich resources below it's surface.

But not too long after you get onto the station you get hit by a meteor shower and a huge chunk of the station gets damaged, lots of people run to check for casualties,
other to the control bridge to check the statistics for oxygen and other life support.

You and 5 others are running to the collision zone where everything seems to have gone out of hands, the room that you need to check got sealed automatically by the station's safety protocol,
this is to prevent air from getting out, you can see bodies floating around with space in the background, your friend tells you that there is nothing they can do at that point.

Next you decide to join the others at the control bridge, but they are not there and you can't connect to them.

(this is as much as i can think of rn for the start of the story)

At some point in the start-mid of the story some unknown space troops (earthlings ofc) appear and are taking over the situation, only 3 of you are left atm and you are taken to a larger station with them.

The game plays a lot like Alien: Isolation except with more people.


For more gameplay mechanics, for giving the player behind the screen some information of your mission, you go to a data point where you recieve your mission information on a screen.
It shows the date etc, you can access more stuff like history where some of the stuff i have said above is listed, some major events etc.

i will keep you guys updated etc.
